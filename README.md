### Mobile-First Web Design

##### **Built With:** JavaScript | HTML5 | CSS3 | Bootstrap 4 | Node.js

Fully-responsive CRUD application, built-from-scratch on top of Bootstrap.

Connected to MongoDB, which handles the server-side rendering of my blog content. This site was created with a particular focus on responsiveness â€” my layouts will work on any device, big or small. My human-centric design approach facilitates intuitive UX. I love to make my pages come to life while still ensuring fast load times and lag-free interactions.

#### Proudest Accomplishments:

- Fully-responsive site custom-developed on top of Bootstrap
- Custom Design, Animations, and Vector Graphics
- Full-stack CRUD application that makes use of REST
- Flexible, reusable component-based design
